"""
This project is a simulator, which trigger launching tests, when detects new changes on github repository.
After that, it takes results from those and previous 5 last runned test suites and generates report in html.

Every suite of tests generates on the end the .txt files with summary with single results.
(The tests are faked and results generated randomly - The goal of project was to implement only flow - how detect
changes and, collect final report and present in a readable way).
